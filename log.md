# 100 Days of Machine Learning Code - LOG
## Day 1: 16 July 2018 

**Today's Progress** : Implemented a linear regression model to predict housing prices with scikit and learnt about fine-tuning it via grid search, randomized search and ensemble methods. Followed tutorials from the textbook: Hands on Machine learning and used various medium articles to supplement theories that was hard to understand

**Thoughts**: It was great to apply linear regression a concept that I had learnt in previous math classes to machine learning and come up with a real-life solution to a problem. I was surprised by how simple it was to actually implement the model and learnt that the real challenge was in cleaning, normalizing and scaling the dataset.
