# 100 Days of Machine Learning Code - LOG
## Day 1: 16 July 2018 

**Today's Progress** : Implemented a linear regression model to predict housing prices with scikit and learnt about fine-tuning it via grid search, randomized search and ensemble methods. Followed tutorials from the textbook: Hands on Machine learning and used various medium articles to supplement theories that was hard to understand

**Thoughts**: It was great to apply linear regression a concept that I had learnt in previous math classes to machine learning and come up with a real-life solution to a problem. I was surprised by how simple it was to actually implement the model and learnt that the real challenge was in cleaning, normalizing and scaling the dataset.

## Day 2: 17 July 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learned to train a binary classifier using stochastic gradient descent(SGD) from sci-kit Learn's SGDClassifier Class for the MNIST dataset. Then used various performance measures such as precision and recall graphs and a ROC curve to see how precise the classifier is and how well it can recall. After learning binary classification went onwards to multi-label classification, using K nearest-neighbor algorithm. Managed to classify the dataset at 97% accuracy by using gride search for KNeighborsClassifier. 

**Thoughts**: Implementing SGD and KNearestNeighbors was pretty easy with very little lines of code needed, what was much harder though was how to measure the performance of the classifier using cross-validation and precision/recall. Learning about the precision/recall tradeof was pretty enlightening and I quite enjoyed it.
